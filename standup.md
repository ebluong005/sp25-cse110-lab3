## 📝 Daily Standup Notes - CSS Sprint

**Date:** 2025-04-23

### 🙋‍♂️ What I Did Yesterday
- Refactored and organized the CSS structure into clearly labeled sections
- Implemented all required **CSS selectors**:
  - Class, ID, Universal, Element, Attribute
  - Pseudo-class selectors (`:hover`, `:active`)
  - Selector list, combinators (descendant, child, adjacent, general sibling)
  - Combined selectors (`element.class`)
  - New selectors: `:has()` and nested-like selectors
- Met the **full color requirements**:
  - Used `rgb`, `rgba`, `hex`, `hsl`, named colors
  - Implemented wide-gamut `color(display-p3 ...)` and `color-mix()`
- Used **CSS Variables** with fallbacks
- Applied longhand and shorthand versions of margin, padding, and border
- Applied box model units: absolute (`px`, `pt`, `em`) and relative (`%`, `vw`, `rem`)
- Completed **Flexbox and Grid layouts** with more than 2 children and 3 attributes each
- Added media query for screens `max-width: 768px` to ensure responsiveness
- Applied font from Google Fonts (Roboto)
